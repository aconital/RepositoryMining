Repository Miner
========================================== 



This is an early version of a repository mining application which goes through
a github repository and gathers information and creates a network between all users and files
who had interacted with each other [currently] through issues and commits and draws a graph

HOW TO: (1)Simply run the application and type in the name of the repository which you are 
looking for [for example: massren]. The application searches within GitHub for all repository which have similar name
(2) Enter the index number of the repository [for example: 0]
(3) Once the graph is created, use mouse scroll to zoom in/out, User T and P buttons to toggle
between picking mode and camera mode. In picking mode you can select a node and move it around.
In camera mode you can pan and move the camera.
